They run Friday March 15 through Sunday March 17 in Santa Clara, CA. From the web to the desktop or up in the clouds, Python is everywhere and we want to know what you’re doing with it. Each year it seems like the schedule gets better and better, so help us keep the streak alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tutorials are 3 hour courses held on the two days preceding the conference talks: March 13 and 14. Whether you’re a full-time educator or just have a topic that you know and want to teach, submit your tutorials today!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See our Call for Proposals for the full details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and registration is open, so sign up! Early bird rates apply to the first 1000 tickets, so get ‘em while they’re hot. We’ve also opened financial aid applications, so please apply if you could use some help with your trip.&lt;/p&gt;
